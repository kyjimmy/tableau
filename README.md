Data visualization, research data tracking dashboard, recruitment summary, user-centred assessment report

### Description:
This project presents real world examples of Tableau dashboards to
  - visualize research/clinical study data (data distribution, key performance indicators (KPIs))
  - summarize study feasibility indices (recruitment rate, response rate, assessment completeness, missing data patterns, assessment time)
  - create user-centred/individual clinical and cognitive assessment reports to support clinicians' decision making.
